# Swimlogs

## Ideas

1. add/accept buttons to upper right and cancel to upper left?
2. parachute, other equipment
3. set intensity slider
4. set style, make only usable when really necessary
5. dragable sets in preview
6. multi select sets for delete/duplicate (and move?)
7. set groups
8. graphs, or some other preview of swam distance
9. rework history

## Cleanup

1. DB types in lowercase so I can I don't have to lower them manually in frontend
   when accessing translations
