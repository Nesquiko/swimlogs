# Swimlogs

## Ideas

1. tags on sets (e.g. sprint, long, freestyle...)
2. parachute, other equipment
3. set intensity slider
4. set style, make only usable when really necessary
5. dragable sets in preview
6. multi select sets for delete/duplicate (and move?)
7. set groups
8. graphs, or some other preview of swam distance
9. rework history
